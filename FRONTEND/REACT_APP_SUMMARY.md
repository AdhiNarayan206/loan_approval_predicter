## 🔗 Navigation

The app includes a sticky navigation bar with two links:

## 🌐 API Integration

The Loan Predictor page connects to your Flask backend at:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000';
```

To change this, edit `src/pages/LoanPredictorPage.jsx`.

2. Make sure your Flask backend is running at http://localhost:5000
3. Navigate between Home and Loan Predictor pages
4. Test the loan prediction form
5. Customize colors, gradients, or content as needed
